# BackupFiles
Use asynchronous tasks to backup your server files on Pocketmine-MP! I made this project for `2` reasons:

- To learn how to use AsyncTask
- For fun :p
## Usage
Through console or in-game, you can use the `/backup` command along with one argument to save your server files.

Supported Arguments: `worlds`, `plugins`, `plugindata`, `all`

The arguments should basiclly be straight foward: worlds save your worlds, plugins save your plugins, plugindata will save your plugin_data, and all will save all of the above.
